# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## 📚 Background Context

This project must be completed in pairs. Students are expected to **pair program** for at least the **mandatory part**.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly and confidently:

### General
- At least **four different sorting algorithms**
- What is the **Big O notation** and how to evaluate the **time complexity** of an algorithm
- How to **choose the most efficient sorting algorithm** for a given input
- What is a **stable sorting algorithm**

---

## 📝 Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation will be done on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**, with:


## 📦 Project Structure

- `sort.h`: Header file including function prototypes and type definitions
- `print_array.c`, `print_list.c`: Provided helper files used for displaying data
- Sorting algorithm implementations, each with its own `.c` file
- Test files (for local use): `main.c`


## 🧾 Provided Resources

### Functions
```c
/* print_array.c */
void print_array(const int *array, size_t size);

/* print_list.c */
void print_list(const listint_t *list);
